## INTRODUCTION

to quickly edit you products without having to go to the edit form and waste 
your valuable time. Just click on the quick edit link and make the necessary 
changes.

After you have installed the module, you will get a new field in each of your 
product types. This field will be outputted as a link on your product page, or 
in the product teaser. Go to the Manage display page 
'admin/commerce/config/product-types/default/edit/display' and look for the 
'Quick product edit' field. Choose where you want this field to show up and that 
is it. Only users with the 'Use the commerce administration pages' permission 
will have access to the quick edit form.
